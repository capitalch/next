I have seen many ups and downs in software industry and change in trends and technology. People say I am good in picking up new technologies and am a good self learner. I solve complex software problems after decomposing them to simple ones.  I excel in devising intelligent algorithms to solve intricate business problems.

In last few years we have seen a massive shift towards open source technologies and software development challenges have increased manifold. At this juncture of time the industry needs time and tested experienced software professionals who are also aware of the old systems. There is acute shortage of such skill-set in the software market. I am proud to say that I belong to such category of software professionals.

Presently in year 2018 I am associated with a multinational company as Chief Technology Officer. I am also doing low end software development work in several technologies as part of my job. I am hands on with latest technology such as ES6, Angular, React, Dart, nodejs and flutter. My company is doing well in terms of business and I am proud of being associated with this company.

I have sufficient free time at present and I am looking for business opportunities in challenging open source software development area.

If somebody has great software development based business idea along with supporting finance and he / she is looking for strong and proven technical cum operational help in carrying out such idea, I am the right person to contact with.
