#### Sushant is passionate about software development
Sushant's first software program was in Visual basic, way back in 1984 in a Casio programmable calculator PB100. Originally, he wanted to be an electronic engineer because of his family retail and servicing business of electronic goods but exposure to programming made him crazy and he shifted to Computer Science in engineering college. There he learnt Fortran, Cobol, Pascal and assembly language. 

After passing out from engineering college Sushant learnt C, Dbase, Foxpro, Clipper, Powerbuilder, Sql Anywhere and Java of his own and using these technologies he gave effect to several projects in financial accounting, HR, Payroll, Finance and Repairs and services. Since year 2005 he worked upon JavaScript, ASP.Net, C#, SharePoint, Sql Server, Oracle, SSIS, SSRS, WPF, WCF and allied proprietary technologies. He developed several web parts in SharePoint during that time. 

Over the years Sushant learnt and worked upon Python, advanced JavaScript, ES6, Angular 2 onwards, React.js, Node.js and associated frameworks. Sushant worked upon several mission critical projects as individual capacity as well as project manager. Sushant always has enjoyed coding at low level. He sacrifised lucrative managerial roles in liew of low level coding due to his passion for coding. 

Due to having received an opportunity of programming in wide spectrum of computer languages Sushant has developed several methodologies, frameworks and libraries which are reused in multiple projects. Most of <a target='_blank' href = 'https://github.com/capitalch'>recent source code of Sushant</a> is available in his GitHub repository. Sushant is devoted to low end software development and he spends over ten hours per day in development and research.

#### Evolution of software development in India
In early matured days of software development per say during year 2005 - 2010, the scope of software development was broadly confined to proprietary technologies as ASP.net, C#, Java, Sql server and oracle. Very few options were available as choice of technology and tools and upgradation of tools was mostly on yearly or once in three-year basis. The technology was quite matured and good documentation with good working code samples were readily available. Some very good business softwares were written in this period.

Gradually open source technology took over since year 2011. Rise of advanced JavaScript as programming language both at client and server side created a massive setback for proprietary languages. Plethora of open source databases such as PostgreSql, MySql and MongoDB evolved which were fit for mission critical software projects. 

The advancement of software development tools started multi dimension and everything worked. The work of a developer became more challenging. A developer now needed to make a choice between several options at client and server end. Documentation would not be very good. There would be cut-throat competition between several technologies. Even version changes would be so frequent sometime in just two weeks. The pace of advancement in development tools would be too high to be tackled by a single person. During this time a new term Full stack developer evolved. At present if you are in development it is widely expected that you work both at client and server side, work upon middleware’s and databases, create good HTML front ends with CSS and JavaScript and do deployment on cloud may it be Microsoft Azure, Amazon’s AWS, Google Cloud or any other cloud service provider.

During this evolution of software development, Sushant observed that many enterprises and people were still glued to the old tools and technology prior to year 2010-11 and they educated their clients accordingly. They did not learn new changes in technology and remained in their comfort zone. Sushant educated himself with new technologies and software development tools.

#### How Sushant fits in software development
Building blocks for today’s most challenging software development work are full stack developers. Ability to learn fast and in definitive manner are keys to success. You must also master the art of learning.

Sushant is proud to say that in past few years he learned how to learn. It is practically impossible to keep so many competitive technologies in mind by a single person, but that is the need of time. Sushant does not have a good memory, so after he masters a technology he steps back and creates key notes about that technology. When it is time to use that technology after few months or even years when he has practically forgotten that, these key notes come to rescue. Over past few years he has such key notes spanning over several hundred pages.

Sushant is good in designing the frameworks to do repetitive work in generic fashion. He developed methodology to resolve complex software problems by simple algorithms. He is confident in advanced JavaScript, ES6, React.js, Next.js, Gatsby, Socket.io, node.js, HTML, SCSS, css-in-js and PostGreSql. he develops full stack and is capable to work through entire life cycle of software development starting from requirement gathering to production deployment.

#### Why single full stack developer is cheaper than multiple single stack developers
Full stack developers are costly. But often they are still cheaper if you consider an alternative arrangement of project manager, Javascript front end developer, UI designer, QA person, API developer, cloud integrator and Database designer to name a few. Remember that most of the work in a great software is done by a single person. With multiple people for client and server side development there comes severe integration problem. In modern open source software development there is less room for project manager and UI designer roles and these are becoming redundant. 

With advent of css-in-js technology a JavaScript developer does the work of UI designer. QA work has become challenging and programming knowledge for doing QA work has now become mandatory. You are expected to know JavaScript if node.js is selected at server side, which is a valid choice. By deploying separate person for each job of Development, QA, UI design, Database design, API development and Deployment the cost may increase many fold. By using full stack developers you can minimize software development costs to a great extent.
