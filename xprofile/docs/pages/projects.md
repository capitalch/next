|  |  |
|:-- | :---|
| URL | <a target='_blank' href='http://chisel.cloudjiffy.net/apps/rx'> chisel.cloudjiffy.net/ apps/rx </a> |
| Motivation | To create on the fly several dynamic data input forms at run time from JSON objects in a react project. All sorts of client and server side validations should be possible. On click of submit button the captured data should be sent to server in JSON format. You should be able to create group of controls in JSON object, group of controls can be added or removed at run time through repeater controls, There could be deep nesting of group of controls or repeater controls. Unlimited nesting of repeater controls should also be possible. That means a repeater inside a repeater inside a repeater to any arbitrary nesting level should be possible.|
| Technology | React core using create-react-app, scss, TypeScript, html5, ES6, node.js deployment in Docker cloud|
| Development effort | 16 man weeks |
| Github repository | <a href='https://github.com/capitalch/react-core/tree/master/rx-forms2' target='_blank'>github.com/ capitalch/ react-core/ tree/master/ rx-forms2 </a>|
| Description | In big projects where you require hundred's of data entry forms along with validations and run time additions or deletions of group of controls, it is non-trivial to manually create each and every form. In that situation the Ornate comes to rescue. You can store form templates in form of JSON objects in database and create run time forms from Ornate as and when required. Any HTML / custom control can be generated. Ornate can work with Material, Bootstrap, Primereact or any other react compatible UI library. Ornate is easily extendable. In the instant example many samle form templates are included. You can play with form templates to generate the forms. Special attraction is **Deeply nested example** in the drop down list. |

##### 3. <a target='_blank' href='http://chisel.cloudjiffy.net/apps/eshop'> chisel.cloudjiffy.net/ apps/eshop </a> POC of e-commerce solution

|:-- | :---|
| URL | <a target='_blank' href='http://chisel.cloudjiffy.net/apps/eshop'>chisel.cloudjiffy.net/ apps/eshop</a> |
| Motivation | To create a POC for e-commerce application using single page application which is fast and scalable.|
| Technology | Angular 6, scss, TypeScript, html5, ES6, PostgreSQL, node.js deployment in Docker cloud|
| Development effort | 12 man weeks |
| Github repository | <a href='https://github.com/capitalch/eshop' target='_blank'>github.com/capitalch/ eshop</a>|
| Description | This is typical POC version of an e-commerce application. This uses dummy products along with their descriptions and fetches product images from online image generator site robohash. You can select product category from left side tree and all products from that category is displayed in the main area. Clicking a product takes you to an enlarged view of the product. Minimum implementation of ordering and payment gateway is also done. This project establishes that an e-commerce application is possible using modern JavaScript frameworks like Angular and React. Much of the work is performed at server side API's created in node.js. Non-trivial database scripts using hierarchical query and JSON query are used for PostgreSql database. Beauty of the application is the speed with which the products and their images are downloaded to client.|
