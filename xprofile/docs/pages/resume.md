The desktop is all time connected through web socket to docker based node.js server in cloud. Mobile phone sends query messages which reaches to business desktop through http + web socket through node.js web server. Business desktop decodes the message and runs a query in local database and returns the results of query to node.js web server which in turn is received back by mobile phone. The entire work is carried on seamlessly and without any failure.
