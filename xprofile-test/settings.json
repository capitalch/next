I generally take around two to four weeks to pick up new skill to be productive.\r\nHaving multiple skills in client and server side is particularly useful for a full stack developer when migration is required.\r\nAt one time I may be hands on in limited number of skills but having knowledge and low level past working experience in other skills is a boon for executing a real time project.\r\n For skills I am presently not hands-on, I may take around 1-2 weeks of warm up time.\r\nFollowing table charts out my skill levels, whether hands on at present and whether I am interested in coding for that skill. I may have knowledge and past working experience for some items, but I may be not interested in working for that."
