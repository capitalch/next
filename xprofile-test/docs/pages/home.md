This site is my technical portfolio. I am a software engineer holding B.Tech degree in computer science from BIT, Mesra, india. I do <span style='color:red'>full stack</span> software development. I am completely hands-on with several software development languages and technology and I plan to do massive development work in years 2019, 2020 and beyond.

After passing out from engineering college I joined my family business. My first mentionable project was to computerize a retail business. Thereafter I developed a service management software to automate repairs and service workflow of authorized service centres. Sometime in year 2005 I joined with my college friend Niraj Tenany to start an offshore development centre in Kolkata, West Bengal and for that I am thankful to him. I am still associated with that company. In this company I worked as technical horsepower and did several projects in Microsoft technology such as asp.net, C#, SharePoint, Sql server, SSIS, SSRS and some projects on Java, JavaScript, Angurar.js and Node.js.

Since year 2017 I concentrated on open source technology and did many projects in advanced JavaScript, React.js, Flutter mobile and Angular.

Over the years I developed tremendous confidence as full stack developer and also as team player in developing various types of complex software in domain of financial accounting, legal, medical and HR. I am hands-on for over 3 decades and posses a success rate of +95%. I have lucrative carrier opportunity for project management but I chose to work as developer.

I crave to work upon mission critical and highly challenging software development work where my power of mind and capabilities are fully used. I have enough available time in hand to work in a project and I can be contacted at capitalch@gmail.com for remote software development work.
